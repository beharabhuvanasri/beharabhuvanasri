I’m a Python learner focused on improving my programming skills through consistent practice, small projects, and hands-on exploration. I enjoy breaking down concepts, experimenting with code, and building things that help me grow as a developer.

I’m working toward becoming confident in writing clean, effective Python code and understanding how different tools and technologies fit together. I believe steady progress and curiosity are the key to improvement.

I’m always open to connecting with developers, mentors, and anyone who enjoys sharing ideas or collaborating on learning-focused projects. Let’s build, learn, and grow together!


Skills: Python, MySQL, Flask API
